## 💻 Projeto

# igniteshoesapp

### In this application that consists of an e-commerce where the user can select the items they will buy

### This rocketseat app was used to learn about how to send notifications to our app with OneSignal

To send notifications we use OneSignal - it has a free plan, uses the Google and iOS notification service, uses keys generated to use these services, and within it we have a dashboard that allows people to create and manage push notifications for devices of our application

Also learn about the development flows - manager workflow (managed workflow, we don't need to touch the native code because they are configured automatically) and Bare Workflow (simple workflow, we have full control of the native code, fantastic android and ios folder presented , make changes to the native code manually)

We create the project as a workflow manager and then use the 'expo build' command to make it a Bare Workflow project

### Some libraries used in the application:

- Asynchronous storage -> to store data on device
- React Navigation/bottom tabs -> to create a menu for the user to navigate different pages
- React-navigation -> to create navigation in the application
- React-native-safe-area-context -> to fit interface components in safe areas of the device
- among others...

### To use the application on your machine:

- download the repository on your machine
- use 'npm run android' command in terminal inside main repository to install app on android emulator

obs. use Android Studio to emulate the Android system and keep it open when executing the above command - after loading everything the application will appear installed on the device
